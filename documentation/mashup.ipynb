    "From the starting 7 source datasets, three different mashup datasets have been created:\n",
    "Id | Dataset | Description (factor of interest) | Original source datasets\n",
    "--- | --- | --- | --- \n",
    "MD1 | Religious observance in each region | RELIGION - % of religious observance in each region (over the total population) | D1, D2, D3 \n",
    "MD2 | Pregnancy rates in young women in each region | PREGNANCY - % of pregnancies in young women (15-25) in each region (over the total population of young women aged 15-25) | D4, D5, D6\n",
    "MD3 | (Higher) education rates in young women in each region | EDUCATION - % of women early leavers (18-24) in each region (over the total population) | D1, D2, D7\n",

    "We did so for each region and therefore gathered the data concerning only females aged 18-24."
