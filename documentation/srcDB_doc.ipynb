    "### D1/2 - Population\n",
    "After closing the 2010-2011 census, Istat decided to move onto a \"permanent census\", aiming at yearly detections (not decennial anymore).\n",
    "Specifically, Istat started doing a \"Censimento permanente della popolazione e delle abitazioni\", regarding population and households, in [2018](https://www.istat.it/it/archivio/199573).\n",
    "\n",
    "These [\"permanent censuses\"](https://www.istat.it/en/censuses) involve, time after time, just representative samples of the population, businesses, and institutions. However, the publication of the obtained data can be considered of \"census\" status, thus referrable to the entire observation field. This is possible thanks to the integration of administrative sources with sample detections, which allows for the exhaustivity, higher quality, and informational offer of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "All the demographic data, detailed to single municipalities, can be found both on I.stat and **demo**. As the latter is a more specific database (and contains even the 2017-2019 years), we have decided to use it instead of I.stat for this specific aspect of our research.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the census refers to the population \"up to the 1st of January\" of the selected year, when selecting the year variable in our dataset we did not choose directly 2017-2018-2019 (our time span of interest), but 2018-2019-2020.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all the reasions mentioned above, we have used two different dataset for the population:\n",
    "1. D1 - \"Population estimates 2002-2019 by age and sex at Jan 1st\" (for the year 2017)\n",
    "2. D2 - \"Resident population by age, sex and marital status on 1st January 2022\" (for the years 2018 and 2019)\n",
    "\n",
    "While for the mashup with the \"PREGNANCY datasets\" (D4, D5, D6) we will need only the population in our age range and gender of interest (15-25, F) for each region, the one with the \"RELIGION dataset\" (D3) will need the whole population for each region. Therefore, it will be necessary to have, for each year and each region, different \"POPULATION\" datasets regarding both our age range and gender of interest and the general population.\n",
