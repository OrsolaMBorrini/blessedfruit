    "## Introduction\n",
    "Many existing studies, mainly focused on the US, have been relating teen pregnancy to a variety of socioeconomic factors that may influence it. Amongst them, low income and poverty, education levels, race or ethnicity and, finally, religion.<br> In this project we wanted to move the focus away from the US, one of the industrialized countries in which teen pregnancy and birth rates are the highest, to Italy, and study whether there could be a relation between education, religion observance and <b>pregnancy rates</b> in the Mediterranean country.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the headquarters of the Catholic Church reside in Vatican City, enclaved in Rome, the relationship between Italians and this Church surely is particularly strong. However, according to <a href=\"https://www.gesis.org/en/eurobarometer-data-service/survey-series/standard-special-eb/study-overview/eurobarometer-904-za7556-december-2018\">Eurostat’s Eurobarometer survey</a> in 2018, 85.6% of Italy’s population is Christian, while 2.6% is a follower of other religions and 11.7% are non-religious. As we wanted to analyse any possible influence on pregnancy rates in young women with no distinction between the various faiths, we have decided to discard the special relation with the Catholic Church and have considered <b>general religious observance</b>.\n",
    "\n",
    "Nevertheless, correlation is not causation, and there are surely many other factors contributing to pregnancy rates in young women: therefore, we have also included the <b>education level</b>, considering the early leavers from higher education (aged 18 to 24).\n"

    "## Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "[<b>Istat</b>](https://www.istat.it/)  is the Italian National Institute of Statistics, the main producer of official statistics in the service of citizens and policy-makers. It is structured in several different databases that allow for browsing and downloading the data produced by the institute for free.<br>\n",
    "Specifically, we have used both general and specific databases:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "<li><a href=\"http://dati.istat.it/?lang=en\"><b>I.Stat</b></a>, a datawarehouse organised by theme, presented in multidimensional tables and with a wide range of standard metadata</li>\n",
    "<li><a href=\"https://esploradati.istat.it/databrowser/#/\"><b>IstatData</b></a>, the new database into which all I.Stat content will be gradually migrated (until the data transfer is completed, the two systems will coexist)</li>\n",
    "<li><a href=\"https://demo.istat.it/?l=en\"><b>Demo - Demography in figures</b></a>, providing official data on resident population in the Italian municipalities and information on main demographic phenomena</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "To make our project as accessible as possible even in the future we have preferred IstatData over I.Stat when possible.\n",
