# Blessed Be the Fruit

#### <i>Is there any observable pattern indicating a correlation between religious observance, pregnancy rates and education level in young women throughout Italy?</i>

"Blessed be the fruit" is an open data project regarding the analysis of factors that might influence pregnancy rates in young women in Italy. Specifically, the research was carried out with a few fundamental conditions:
<ul>
<li>The time-span selected is that of 2017-2019 (in order to not work on data affected by COVID-19);</li>
<li>For simplicity reasons, we have decided to stick with the binary definition of gender employed in the source datasets (and therefore selected only "females");</li>
<li>The age range is that of 15-25;</li>
<li>The factors analysed are religious observance in the general population and education level in young women</li>
</ul>
 
The research encompasses in-depth analyses of different aspects of open data regarding quality, legalty, ethics and technicalities, and different visualizations support the communication and ensure a better understanding of the results.

The project has been developed for the "Open Access and Digital Ethics" course held by Monica Palmirani @ University of Bologna, MA "DHDK"
